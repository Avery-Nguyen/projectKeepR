S.H.I.E.L.D.
=========

## Project Overview

S.H.I.E.L.D. is an app designed to store your login information. You can add however many different accounts you may have (ie LinkedIn, Github, social media, or any different account you may be registered to) and S.H.I.E.L.D. encrypts and stores the login information so you can relax and not stress about what password goes matches with which account! S.H.I.E.L.D. can even generate you a random password so your accounts are even more secure!

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
